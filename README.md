# users-api-mongo

This is a version of [Users API](https://github.com/matt-ball/users-api/) that uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for storage rather than memory.

It is intended as a very simple, easy to understand codebase. The intent behind this is to ensure folks can follow along during live demos where the codebase is being modified and extended.
